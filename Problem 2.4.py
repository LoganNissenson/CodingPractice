# Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, sucn that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x
# IMPORTANT: The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "Right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions
# The additional spacing in the example indicates teh partition. Yes, the output below is one of many valid outputs
#
#Input 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5-> 10 -> 2 -> 1 (partition 5)
# Output 3 ->1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
